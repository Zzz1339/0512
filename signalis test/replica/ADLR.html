        <p class="unit-description">ADLR (Administration-, Datenverarbeitung-, Logistik-Replika, Administration, Data Processing, Logistics Replika 'Eagle') or Adler, are Generation 5 High Command Specialist Replikas. 
            Adlers are Protektor FÃ¼hrungskommando Administrator units. Adler means "Eagle" in German.
            Adler units are in charge of managing and overseeing all administrative tasks for the entire facility. 
            They have the responsibility of allowing Operational Command units such as Falke to focus on direct control of Protektor units. 
            Adler units are designed to work as a direct counterpart to Falke unit, serving as her adjutant by taking care of necessary paperwork and calculations.</p>
