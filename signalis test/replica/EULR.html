        <p class="unit-description"> EULR (Einfache Universelle Leichte Replika), (Simple Universal Light Replika 'Owl') or Eule, are Generation 4 Low-Cost General Purpose Replikas. These units are the standard multi-purpose unit of the Eusan Nation deployed in domestic tasks such as serving as Cooks, Nurses, Cleaning, as well as Simple Medical and Office Workers,Teachers. Eule means "Owl" in German.
            Eules are not designed to be used in combat scenarios with their lightweight frame not suitable for direct combat. Instead they are seen as prime candidates for isolated and distant facilities where supplies may be limited. They are also useful due to being cheap to produce for the Nation.</p>
